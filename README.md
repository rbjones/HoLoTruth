Decentralised Autonomous Higher Order Logic

This project seeks to place interactive and automated proof, in diverse languages interpreted in Higher Order Logic, in its proper very broad context, around which an all-enveloping deductive ecosystem is envisaged.

The very first stage of this project, prior to inviting collaborators, is the writing in the project wiki of a "manifesto", sketching the nature of the proposed enterprise.
